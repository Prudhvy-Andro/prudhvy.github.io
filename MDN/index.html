    <p>Our mission is to ensure the Internet is a global public resource, open and accessible to all. An Internet that truly puts people first, where individuals can shape their own experience and are empowered, safe and independent.</p>
    <p>MDN's mission is simple: to provide developers with the information they need to easily build projects on the open Web. If it's an open technology exposed to the Web, we want to document it.

        In addition, we provide documentation about Mozilla products and how to build and contribute to Mozilla projects.
        
        If you're not sure whether a particular topic should be covered on MDN, read: Does this belong on MDN?</p>
